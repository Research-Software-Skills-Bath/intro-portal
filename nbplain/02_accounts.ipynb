## Where can I see the accounts I have access to?

You can navigate to the accounts screen to see what accounts you have on the system from the portal home page:

![Research Finance Portal](../images/ResearchFinancePortalAccount.png)

or from the sidebar `Accounts` menu:

![Research Finance Portal](../images/AccountSidebar.png)

Once you’ve selected **Accounts** you will see a list of accounts you have access to.  

Against each account listed, a set of options for:

- Managing / Viewing account  
- Allocating budgets  
- Viewing finance  
- Viewing Storage Allocations  

will be available.

---

## How do I add an account?

Navigate to the accounts screen and click the `Set Up New Account` button:

![Portal Account](../images/SetUpAccount1.png)

From the drop down menu in `Link Agresso Project Code` select the Agresso code you wish to set up a new account for.

If you are expecting to see an Agresso project code in the list but it is not shown, it is either because:

- The Agresso project code has already been linked to an account  
- You have not been set up as the budget holder in Agresso  
- The Agresso project code has not been allocated a budget for High Performance Computing  

Information on requesting a budget for High Performance Computing can be found here:  
https://rcam.bath.ac.uk/HPC%20Budget%20Request%20Form%20Guide.pdf

Once you have selected the Agresso account you wish to set up click `Create and Next`.

![Portal Account](../images/SetUpAccount4.png)

The next screen simply lists the Agresso Account details:

![Account Set up](../images/SetUpAccount5.png)

On the next screen you can add a description and tags to the account:

![Account Set up](../images/SetUpAccount6.png)

You can then assign the **Account Administrator** role to other users.

This role grants the member access to manage the account with the ability to:

- Allocate budgets across resource allocations  
- View budget and expenditure  
- Manage **all** resource allocations within the account  

The budget holder is automatically assigned as an Account Administrator.

To assign this role to another person, type the name or username in the search box and click **Add Member**:

![Account Set up](../images/SetUpAccount7.png)

You can then assign the **Account Viewer** role to other users.

This role gives the user view access to the account including the ability to:

- View budget allocations and finance  
- View all resource allocations  
- View all resource allocation transactions within the account  

To assign this role, type the name or username in the search box and click **Add Member**:

![Account Set up](../images/SetUpAccount8.png)

Having set up this account, you can configure the account, add/remove membership, and edit account details by clicking the **Manage Account** icon.

# Account Storage (Account-Level Quotas)

Account Storage allows you to view the storage quota associated with an account and monitor current usage.

Storage is configured at the **account level**, and resource allocations under the account draw from this quota.

---

## Where do I view Account Storage?

1. Go to **Accounts** from the sidebar.
2. Locate your account.
3. Click the **Storage Allocations** icon in the Actions column.

![Accounts – Storage Allocations](../images/Account_Storage_01.png)

This opens the **Account Storage** page for the selected account.

## Adding Storage to an Account

On the **Account Storage** page:

1. Select a storage option from the dropdown menu.
2. Click **Add**.

⚠️ **Important:**  
Only **Research Computing Administrators** can set or modify storage quotas.

If you do not have permission, you can view storage information but must contact the Research Computing team to request quota changes.

---

## Understanding the Storage Table

Each row represents a storage allocation attached to the account (for example: *Nimbus Campaign*).

The columns mean:

- **Total Account Allocation (GB)**  
  The storage quota assigned at the account level.

- **Total Quota Across Resource Allocations (GB)**  
  The total quota distributed across resource allocations under the account.

- **Total Latest Usage (GB)**  
  The most recent recorded storage usage (updated periodically throughout the day).

---

## Editing Storage (Administrators Only)

If you have the required permissions:

- Click the **Edit (pencil icon)** on the storage row.
- Adjust the quota as required.

If you do not have permission, provide the following information when contacting Research Computing:

- Account ID  
- Storage name (e.g. Nimbus Campaign)  
- Requested quota (GB)  
- Brief justification (project requirements, expected duration, etc.)
